## from the paper: 'month, hour, working day and temperature are selected as most important features for hourly scale
## and month, working-day and temperature are selected as final features for daily scale' (result of feature selection)

## PART 2 (questions probably need to be reformulated)
# who is biking at ass-o'clock in the morning??? casual vs registered riders
# how is casual vs registered biking affected during holidays? (expect more casual riders?)
# how is casual vs registered biking affected during e.g. summer? (increased tourism?)
# at e.g. 1am on a rainy january morning, is it more likely that a registered or a casual rider will rent a bike?

## ACTUALLY PART 3!!!
pairs(day_dat$cnt ~ day_dat$mnth + day_dat$workingday + day_dat$temp, pch=16)
# month and temp: highly correlated (obviously---temperature changes with the time of year), obvious nonlinearity
# count and temp: nonlinear behavior (makes sense---people probably prefer to bike on a day where the weather is
# not too hot and not too cold)
# count and month: nonlinearity, but also makes sense for temperature reasons

pairs(hour_dat$cnt ~ hour_dat$mnth + hour_dat$hr + hour_dat$workingday + hour_dat$temp, pch=16)
# month and temp: same correlation and nonlinearity as in day.csv
# hour and temp: continued nonlinearity and correlation (temperature naturally changes with time of day)
# count and tempt: same behavior as in day.csv
# count and month: nonlinearity (temperature-dependent, presumably)
# count and hour: nonlinearity (who's out biking at 4am???)
